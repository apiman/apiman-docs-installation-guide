= Apiman Production Guide {{ book.apiman.version.release }}

This guide should serve as a guide to manually deploy apiman into production.
// However, we also offer a
// simple shell script that can do much of the work for you.
// It will likely always be a work in progress,
// so many production deployers may not feel comfortable using it.
// However, it can currently install the
// following components:

== Architecture Summary
Before we get started, it may be useful to know the overall architecture of apiman.
Let's start with a picture!

.Architecture of apiman

The apiman solution is made up of a number of pieces, including:

* Keycloak Authentication Server
* Relational Database
* Elasticsearch Datastore
* apiman API Gateway
* apiman API Manager

The image above should give you an idea of how they all fit together.

== Elasticsearch

If you wish to enable metrics in apiman (who doesn't?) you'll need to install Elasticsearch.  This is
because the API Gateway stores all metrics information in Elasticsearch (by default), and the API Manager
queries that data to present analytics information in the UI.

Please see the Elasticsearch documentation for how to install and configure it in production.  Ultimately you
will need Elasticsearch running in a well known and accessible location.  We also recommend you enable
authentication (e.g. via Shield) and SSL.

TIP: The data in Elasticsearch is not backed up or stored in some other location - Elasticsearch is being
used as the primary/canonical data store for the metrics information.  You may wish to configure backup
procedures


== Keycloak
In production, it is typically preferred to deploy Keycloak server as a standalone solution.  For more
specific information about how to configure a standalone Keycloak server, see the Keycloak documentation:

http://keycloak.github.io/docs/userguide/html/server-installation.html

Once Keycloak is installed as a standalone server, you must configure the â€˜apiman' realm.  This realm will
be used for authentication into each of the apiman components (API Manager REST services, API Manager UI,
API Gateway REST services, etc).

TIP: You can configure additional Keycloak Realms for use with the apiman "Keycloak OAuth2 Policy".

Fortunately, apiman comes with a realm file you can import.  Simply log into your Keycloak server and then
create the apiman realm using this file:

https://github.com/apiman/apiman/blob/master/distro/data/src/main/resources/data/apiman-realm.json

WARNING: The realm file contains some credentials/secrets that you will want to modify or regenerate. The defaults are obviously *not* secure.

Once you have created the apiman realm, you must use the Keycloak UI to add your API Manager UI as a valid
redirect URL for the 'apimanui' client.  To do this, log into the Keycloak admin console and choose the
*apiman* realm.  Next click "clients" in the left navigation, and choose *apimanui* in the resulting list.
From there you can add public URL if your API Manager UI to the list of "*_Valid Redirect URIs_*".  It might
be something like:

    https://apimanager.mycompany.org:8443/apimanui/*

That will allow users of the API Manager UI to actually log in and be properly redirected back to the
application!

NOTE: If you're behind load-balancers, you may need to ensure https://keycloak.github.io/docs/userguide/keycloak-server/html/server-installation.html#proxy-address-forwarding[X-Forwarded-For] is set properly.

    * Optional: Before launching, remove `apiman-gateway.war` from the deployment.
. Download the {vertx-gw}[Vert.x distro] and launch using the `conf-es.json` configuration.
. Log into the apiman UI footnote:[Typically this will be http://localhost:8080/apimanui] as an admin user (default: admin/admin123!).
. Follow the steps outlined in the {gw-install-walkthrough}[gateway installation walkthrough] footnote:[If you created a new gateway rather than editing an existing entry, you may want to delete the old one to avoid any confusion.].

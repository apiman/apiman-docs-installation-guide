= How To: Use a SQL Database to Store and Retrieve Metrics (Replacing Elasticsearch)

Sometimes you just don't want to use Elasticsearch to store your metrics, even though it's rather good at it.

We typically recommend that you stick with ES if possible, because it gives you the option of installing Kibana, opening up a whole new world of advanced analytics over the metric data.

However, if all you want is the basic graphs/charts shown in the Apiman UI, you can easily switch to storing metric data in a database.

== High Level Overview

. Deploy an appropriate JDBC datasource
. Enable the Apiman Gateway JDBC initializer
. Configure the Apiman Gateway metrics provider to be JDBC
. Configure the API Manager metrics accessor to be JDBC

== Set up or deploy an appropriate JDBC datasource

Using a set of system properties or environment variables, Apiman can quickly bootstrap your JDBC datasource.
If your setup isn't supported out of the box, you may need to configure your own datasources, including JDBC drivers.

Please refer to the xref:registries-and-components/../manager/configuration.adoc#apiman_manager_database_config[Apiman database configuration] section for how to do this.

== Enable the Apiman Gateway JDBC initializer

A database schema must be installed in your Apiman Gateway database, which creates the tables and indexes needed.

This schema can be automatically created by Apiman the first time it is used.

To enable this feature, you must configure the Apiman Gateway JDBC initializer in the *apiman.properties* file, like so:

[source,properties]
----
apiman.jdbc.datasource.jndi-location=java:jboss/datasources/apiman-gateway
apiman-gateway.initializers=jdbc
apiman-gateway.initializers.jdbc=io.apiman.gateway.engine.jdbc.JdbcInitializer
apiman-gateway.initializers.jdbc.datasource.jndi-location=${apiman.jdbc.datasource.jndi-location}
apiman-gateway.initializers.jdbc.datasource.type=mysql5
----

This initializer will run whenever Apiman starts up, and it will install the Apiman Gateway schema/DDL into the configured database so that the metrics JDBC implementations can function properly.

Note that you will need to set the correct value of *apiman-gateway.initializers.jdbc.datasource.type* based on the specific database you will be using.

Possible values for this property include:

* h2
* mysql5
* postgresql9
* mssql11
* oracle12

== Configure the Apiman Gateway metrics provider to be JDBC

JDBC-based metrics can be selected in *apiman.properties* via:

[source,properties]
----
apiman-gateway.metrics=io.apiman.gateway.engine.jdbc.JdbcMetrics
apiman-gateway.metrics.datasource.jndi-location=${apiman.jdbc.datasource.jndi-location}
----

== Configure the API Manager metrics accessor to be JDBC

If you have configured the Apiman Gateway to use JDBC, then it likely makes sense to configure the API Manager to *retrieve* those metrics via JDBC, also.

Edit the *apiman.properties* file:

[source,properties]
----
apiman-manager.metrics.type=io.apiman.manager.api.jdbc.JdbcMetricsAccessor
apiman-manager.metrics.datasource.jndi-location=${apiman.jdbc.datasource.jndi-location}
----

[TIP]
====
If you are deploying the API Manager and Apiman Gateway separately (on different nodes), make sure you edit the correct `apiman.properties` files on the correct nodes.

If you wish, you can make the same changes to all nodes, since any properties in `apiman.properties` will be ignored on nodes where certain components are excluded.

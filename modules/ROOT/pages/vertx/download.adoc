= Apiman Vert.x Gateway

The apiman Vert.x distro is our premier gateway offering and should provide the best performance characteristics of any of our platforms.

The implementation is the _apiman gateway_ only, and hence is normally paired with the Manager and UI from the xref:servlet/wildfly.adoc[Servlet edition] (e.g. WildFly, EAP, Jetty, etc), but it can be run headless for specific workloads.

There are a few different common configuration examples shipped with the Vert.x distro; they are outlined in more detail below, but you can customise your configurations however you see fit by xref:registries-and-components/overview.adoc[mixing and matching components].

== Download & launch

Download the latest apiman Vert.x distro from http://www.apiman.io/latest/download.html#vertx[apiman.io downloads] page, or:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
wget https://github.com/apiman/apiman/releases/download/{apiman-version-release}/apiman-distro-vertx-{apiman-version-release}.zip
----

Extract the archive and execute it with:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
unzip apiman-distro-vertx-{apiman-version-release}
cd apiman-distro-vertx-{apiman-version-release}
./apiman-gateway.sh --conf configs/conf-es.json
----

Where `config-es.json` is your configuration file.
Refer to the config and its annotations for additional detail.

If the gateway has started successfully then you should see console output similar to:

[source,log]
----
$ ./apiman-gateway.sh --conf configs/conf-es.json

== Test your gateway

To quickly verify whether the installation is working, try footnote:[If a non-default host, port and protocol, otherwise alter the command accordingly.]:

[source,bash]
----
  $ curl -v 'http://apimanager:apiman123!@localhost:8081/system/status'
----

WARNING: You must alter the default passwords and enable SSL for production deployments, otherwise your system will be at risk.

Version information can be displayed with the `version` flag footnote:[When a SNAPSHOT version is used, further information is displayed to identify the precise commit used to build the project and understand the state of the git repo. For example: `Apiman 1.3.1-SNAPSHOT apiman-1.3.0.Final-3-g1b9ebf5 2017-05-08 12:15:53`.]:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./apiman-gateway.sh --version
[INFO ] ApimanVersionCommand - Apiman 1.3.0.Final
[INFO ] ApimanVersionCommand - Vert.x 3.4.0
----

== Configurations

Some example configurations ship with the distro, aiming to provide sensible defaults.

TIP: Refer to the comments within the shipped configuration files, the xref:vertx/config-guide.adoc[configuration guide] and the xref:registries-and-components/overview.adoc[registries & components] documentation for further detail.


=== Elasticsearch

The Elasticsearch config `conf-es.json` comes pre-configured with Elasticsearch components.

Alter the `variables.apiman.es` configuration variables to match your Elasticsearch setup.

You can either use the Elasticsearch instance bundled with the _Apiman Manager_, or run your own cluster (which is the preferred option for production).

You can optionally set a username and password; this is only useful if you are using a security service like Elasticsearch Shield to enable authentication.

[source,json5]
----
{
  "variables": {
    "apiman": {
      "es": {
        "protocol": "http",
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 19200, // <1>
        "username": null, // Optional
        "password": null, // Optional
        "timeout": 10000
        // etc
      }
    }
  },
  // rest of your config...
}
----
<1> The default port of a standalone ES cluster is typically 9200. The ES bundled with the _apiman Manager_ is set to 19200 by default to avoid port clashes.

NOTE: Refer to the xref:registries-and-components/elasticsearch.adoc[Elasticsearch registries & components documentation] for a complete list of configuration options.

=== Headless Elasticsearch

The Apiman Headless Elasticsearch config `conf-headless-es.json` uses an immutable registry to load its configuration from a local or remote JSON file. All other components (e.g. metrics, rate-limiting, etc) use Elasticsearch.

First, alter your configuration as detailed in the <<Elasticsearch>> section.

Then, modify the `registry.config` section of the config:

[source,json5]
----
"registry": {
  "class": "io.apiman.gateway.engine.vertx.polling.URILoadingRegistry",
  "config": {
    "configUri": "file:///path/to/my/json/reg-config.json", // <1>
    "auth": "NONE" // <2>
  }
},
----
<1> A file, http or https URI to a JSON file containing the registry configuration, as detailed in xref:registries-and-components/headless.adoc#_configuration_file_format[Configuration File Format].
<2> Authentication method to retrieve the file, as detailed in link:../registries-and-components/headless.adoc#_authentication[Authentication].

NOTE: Refer to the xref:registries-and-components/headless.adoc[Elasticsearch headless registry documentation] for a complete list of configuration options.

= Apiman Developer Portal

As of version 3, Apiman includes a customisable developer portal, which is focussed entirely on the API consumer experience.
None of the advanced features or complexity of the main Apiman UI.
Plus, it's very easy to customise it with your organisation's style and branding.

[.MaintainerMessage]
****
The developer portal is new in Apiman 3, and the documentation is still being developed.

You can help the project by https://www.github.com/apiman/apiman-developer-portal[providing your feedback and making contributions^].
It is a standard Angular 13+ application, so if you have some UI/UX skills, we'd greatly welcome your input!

== WildFly

In the Apiman WildFly distribution, you can access the API Developer Portal on the `/portal` endpoint (e.g. http://localhost:8080/portal).
It is also part of the Docker Compose quickstart.

For WildFly, the developer portal assets referred to in the rest of this guide are in: `standalone/configuration/portal/`.

== Basic Configuration

The most important file for customisation is `assets/config.json5`.

[source,json5]
----
{
  // set language the API Developer Portal is running in
  "language": "en", // <1>
  // if new languages are available add them here (must exist in assets/i18n)
  "supportedLanguages": ["de", "en"],
  // do not change this
  "theme": "custom",
  // config options for header
  "hero": {
    "title": "HOME.TITLE", // <2>
    "subtitle": "HOME.SUBTITLE", // <3>

    "large": true,
  },
  // config options for navigation below header
  "navigation": {
    "showHomeLink": true,
    "links": [], // <4>
    "separator": ""
  },
  // config options for footer
  "footer": {
    // additional links to be shown in footer

        "link": "https://www.apiman.io/",
        "openInNewTab": true
      }
    ],
    // tell the application how the menu separator should look like
    "separator": "â€¢"
  },
  // specify the entrypoint to the API Management Manager: This is MANDATORY for communication with backend
  "endpoint": "${apiman-manager-ui.api.endpoint}", // <6>
  // the SSO role that the manager endpoint requires
  "backendRoles": ["view-profile", "devportaluser"],
  // set authentication details when pressing "login" telling where to redirect for SSO login with keycloak
  "auth": {
    "url": "${apiman.auth.public.url}",  // <7>
    "realm": "${apiman.auth.realm}",  // <8>
    "clientId": "devportal" // <9>
  },
  // set your desired terms and conditions for API subscriptions here. Could be disabled so no such infos will be shown.
  "terms": { // <10>
    "enabled": true,
    // both provided links will always be opened in a new browser tab

<1> Default language for the portal. Translations are in `i18n/de.json`.
<2> Page title: ideally, reference this to an i18n constant.
<3> Page subtitle: ideally, reference this to an i18n constant.
<4> Links at the top of the developer portal. These have the same format as the footer links, see <5>.
<5> Array of link objects to custom resources.
<6> This is where your Apiman Manager backend is. Resolved automatically against `apiman.properties`, but you can override it.
<7> Keycloak auth URL, this must be accessible by the browser application. Resolved automatically against `apiman.properties`, but you can override it.
<8> Keycloak realm, usually as defined in `apiman.properties`.

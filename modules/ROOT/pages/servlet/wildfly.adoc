= WildFly

== Overview

This guide explores downloading and installing the Apiman quickstarts.

The distribution consists of:

* Apiman Manager (`apiman.war`)
* Apiman Manager UI (`apimanui.war`)
* Apiman Developer Portal UI (`apiman-developer-portal.war`)
* Apiman Gateway (`apiman-gateway.war`)
* Apiman Gateway API (`apiman-gateway-api.war`)

== Prerequisites

[[keycloak_setup]]
=== Set up Keycloak IDM

In order to manage our users and provide login security we will use Keycloak.

For instructions, please refer to: xref:keycloak.adoc[]

We will assume you have not changed anything from the default Keycloak realm definition for the purposes of this guide footnote:[Available in your distro zip, `apiman/data/default-realm-for-apiman.json`].
Please substitute your changes, where appropriate.

=== Installing Apiman on WildFly

Apiman can target https://www.wildfly.org[WildFly^] as a runtime environment.
In order to install Apiman you will need to download both WildFly and the Apiman overlay distribution.

Once both are downloaded, it's a simple matter of unpacking both into the same location.

[#_download]
==== Download

First you will need to download both WildFly and Apiman:

. http://download.jboss.org/wildfly/{wildfly-version}/wildfly-{wildfly-version}.zip[Download WildFly {wildfly-version}]

. http://downloads.jboss.org/apiman/{apiman-version-release}/apiman-distro-wildfly-{apiman-version-release}-overlay.zip[Download Apiman {apiman-version-release}]

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
wget https://download.jboss.org/wildfly/{wildfly-version}/wildfly-{wildfly-version}.zip

wget https://github.com/apiman/apiman/releases/download/{apiman-version-release}/apiman-distro-wildfly-{apiman-version-release}-overlay.zip
----

==== Unpack

Once both files have been downloaded, simply unpack both in the same location.

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
unzip wildfly-{wildfly-version}.zip

unzip -o apiman-distro-wildfly-{apiman-version-release}-overlay.zip -d wildfly-{wildfly-version}
----

== Run Apiman on WildFly

IMPORTANT: Ensure you have set `APIMAN_AUTH_URL` as described in the <<keycloak_setup, Keycloak Setup>> section.

The Apiman overlay contains everything needed to run Apiman, including:

* Apiman binaries (several WAR files)
* Apiman-specific WildFly configuration (*`standalone-apiman.xml`*)
* Apiman RDBMS datasource (h2)
* Drivers for some popular databases, including H2, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. See xref:manager/database.adoc[] for more.
* Pre-configured *`admin`* user with password *`admin123!`*

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
export APIMAN_AUTH_URL=<Your keycloak URL>
cd wildfly-{wildfly-version}
./bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-apiman.xml
----

== Logging In

Once Apiman is running, you should be able to log in to the API Manager by pointing your browser at the following URL:

[source,bash]
----
http://localhost:8080/apimanui/
----

Log in with credentials *`admin`/`admin123!`*

[CAUTION]
====
We strongly advise that you immediately change the Keycloak admin user's password, as well as the *_admin_* user found in the *_apiman_* realm!

You can do that by logging into your Keycloak console.
If you followed this tutorial, it will be at http://localhost:8081/admin/

== Installing using Docker

* We have a variety of Docker images available with Apiman broken into its components.
You can find them at: https://github.com/apiman/apiman-docker/#apiman-docker-images[apiman/apiman-docker^].

* xref:/quickstart.adoc[Refer to our Docker Compose quickstart guide] for a full Docker setup that is already configured for you.

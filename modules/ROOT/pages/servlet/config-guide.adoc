= Servlet Configuration

The Servlet version of the Apiman gateway uses Java properties as its primary source of configuration.

This includes such platforms as WildFly and Tomcat.

== Configuration Properties

All the Apiman WARs share a common configuration file called *apiman.properties*, which for the WildFly and EAP editions can be found in *standalone/configuration*.

This file therefore contains configuration settings for all three applications (API Manager, API Manager UI, API Gateway).

Please refer to the `apiman.properties` file itself, as well as this documentation, for more information on each property's purpose and possible values.

To discover available options for components, refer to the link:../registries-and-components/overview.adoc[Registries & Components] documentation.

TIP: If you are running a non-Servlet gateway implementation (e.g. Vert.x), then you should refer to that gateway's configuration documentation to understand how to configure that element.

//== Variables
//
//The configuration supports variable substitution (transclusion) in the form `"${FOO.SOME_VARIABLE}"`; where `FOO.SOME_VARIABLE` is the variable to be transcluded.
//The following list defines the lookup sources and order of precedence for variable resolution.
//
//1. Properties defined in `apiman.properties`:
//+
//[source,properties]
//----
//FOO.SOMEVARIABLE=1234
//# some.value will now become 1234
//some.value=${FOO.SOMEVARIABLE}
//----
//2. System properties: `-DFOO.SOME_VARIABLE="foo"`
//3. Environment: `export FOO.SOME_VARIABLE="foo"`
//
//A default value can be provided, which will be used if other lookup sources fail.
//
//For example `${MAGIC_NUMBER:-8090}` will result in `8090` being set if `MAGIC_NUMBER` is unresolved after the prior steps.

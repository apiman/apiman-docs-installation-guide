= WildFly/EAP Production Guide

The easiest way to install just the API Gateway is to download and install the Apiman quickstart overlay ZIP and then remove the extraneous components.

Follow that up with some modification of the `apiman.properties` configuration file, and you'll be Gatewaying in no time!

Here are the steps you should take to install a standalone API Gateway:

. Download and unpack WildFly
. Download Apiman
. Unpack Apiman into WildFly
. Remove unused Apiman deployments from standalone/deployments

[source,bash]

rm standalone/deployments/apiman.war
rm standalone/deployments/apimanui.war

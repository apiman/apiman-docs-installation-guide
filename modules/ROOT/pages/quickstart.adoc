== Vert.x Gateway and Servlet-based Manager

Apiman consists of two broad parts, the Gateway and the Manager.
This quickstart separates those elements, with the Gateway implemented in Vert.x; our most performant platform, and the Manager a Servlet-based implementation.

They are linked together in a trivial few steps.

. Select and download a xref:servlet/wildfly.adoc[Servlet all-in-one distro] of Apiman (e.g. WildFly, Tomcat).
    * Optional: Before launching, remove `apiman-gateway.war` from the deployment.
. Download the xref:vertx/download.adoc[Vert.x distro] and launch using the `conf-es.json` configuration.
. Log into the Apiman UI {ui-footnote} as an admin user (default: admin/admin123!).
. Follow the steps outlined in the {gw-install-walkthrough}[gateway installation walkthrough] footnote:[If you created a new gateway rather than editing an existing entry, you may want to delete the old one to avoid any confusion.].

ðŸŽ‰  Done!

== Servlet-based Gateway and Servlet-based Manager

The Servlet-based quickstart is an all-in-one with little-or-no additional configuration needed to get going. You can start with this platform and migrate to the Vert.x gateway at a later date. It's ideal for trying out Apiman in the shortest possible time.

. Select and download a xref:servlet/wildfly.adoc[Servlet all-in-one distro] of Apiman (e.g. WildFly, EAP, Tomcat).
. Launch and log into the Apiman UI.

ðŸŽ‰  Done!

== Docker Compose

The easiest way to try Apiman is with our Docker Compose distribution.
It is also arranged in a way that is more representative of a real-world deployment; broken down into its constituent parts, with all features enabled, and using a production-grade database.

. Download the {docker-compose-distro}[Apiman Docker Compose distribution^].
. `unzip apiman-docker-compose-{apiman-version-release}.zip && cd apiman-docker-compose-{apiman-version-release}`
. `docker-compose -f docker-compose.setup.yml up`
. `docker-compose up`
. Open http://apiman.local.gd:8080/apimanui
. ðŸŽ‰ Success!

[TIP]
====
* Refer to the distro's **`README.adoc`** for more information, it's in the root of the zip.
You will find a list of endpoints, including devportal and a mock mail server.

* It may take a short while to boot all services and for the Apiman endpoints to become available, especially if you are using a system with virtualised container support (e.g. Windows).

* Don't forget to look at `.env` for a variety of useful settings.
